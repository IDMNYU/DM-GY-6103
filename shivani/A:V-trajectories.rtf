\f0\fs24 \cf0 Kandinsky\'92s 
\f1\i Color-Tone Dramas
\f0\i0  resonated with me the most of the live A/V trajectories pieces. Working at the interstice of aesthetics, design, and computation, I think about synesthesia often.

In a literal sense, Kandinsky\'92s metaphor regarding keys that set the soul vibrating is reminiscent of the practice involving blending the digital with the poetic. Looking at his ingenious endeavors in blending mediums to engage with and share the human condition is an encouraging reminder that the pursuit of innovation of human expression is eternal}
