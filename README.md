Work on your own branches and do pull requests to pass work in.

Organize your work in folders with your name at the top level of the repo.

Josh's patches from class will be arranged in their own folders. Patches from outside of class will be in the /out-of-class-patches/ folder. 

DO NOT ADD MEDIA to this repo. Learn how to use .gitignore!

Don't suffer in silence! Use the class slack and post in #git or #max!
